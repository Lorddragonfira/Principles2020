## Principle 7: Correction of Personal Information

### In order to comply with this particular principle when developing an IT software we must ensure that there is a way to request and have contact between the clients and vendor when they request that personal information be corrected on the website

- [ ] Have a personal settings page where one can edit their personal information at any time as long as its within the reasons and the confines of what we need/want/allow
- [ ] Have a check system or complaints page where they can directly contact the support team when there is a refusal of correction. The team or page will then explain why certain corrections were refused, and that although we can't correct it that they have the rights to complain to a privacy comissioner or they have the rights to have their statement of correction attached to the disputed information.


## Principle 1: Purpose of collection of Personal Information

### An IT software must only collect the personal information that they need for their purpose and use data minimization to ensure no other unnecessary data is collected.

- [ ] Make sure to only include the necessary Personal Information in the collection form. For example an online magazine subscription should only need an email address and name not their drivers license and passport numbers.
- [ ] Need to be very clear and explain to the client when collecting personal information the purpose of the data collection. For example an online magazine subscription only needs email and name so they can send the Magazine to the correct person and they need to make it very clear before the collection form.

## Principle 2: Source of personal information 

### An IT software must establish who the best person is to aquire personal data about an individual from. (Usually the individual who the personal information is about.) However, consent and authentication must be thoroughly checked to insure that the right individual's personal information is being collected. 

- [ ] Have an authentication system that thoroughly confirms and checks the person who we are collecting information from accepts and gives consent for the personal information being collected. This person is usually the person themselves of course. In NZ we can use Realme or use two or three factor authentification systems. For example 1:Email address, 2: Phone Number, 3: Have an app authenticator (Blizzard authenticator app)
- [ ] When the person gives personal data about someone else, make sure you have consent from the individual whom it concerns or that lawfully it is okay. E.g Have a system in place where consent legitimacy can be checked and given. Working with the law enforcement and getting information through them. Only do this though when attaining the information of the individuals through their consent might mean that it coincides with the law.
- [ ] Have systems in check for any secruity flaws, e.g hire a security company to try and cheat the authentication system or "hack" into a persons account, and have them report the findings and where improvements can be made.


## Principle 3: Collection of Information

### The vendor must be very clear and open to the client why they are collecting the information and what they will be doing with this information
- [ ] Notify the clients when they are giving the information, why we need the data, who is receiving the data, whether it is compulsory or volantary and what will happen if they refuse to give information. For example online magazine subscription, explain during the collection process...... why do we need their email - so that we have an address/location to send the subscription, who is getting this info - We are, whether its compulsory or volantary, What will happen on refusal - You dont get the subsciption services.
- [ ] There are exceptions to this though, if it is not practically reasonable under certain circumstances. For example the safety of a person, the maintanence of the law. E.G online magazine - we need an individuals email as the law requires us to send the magazine to their email address as it will save the whole world but it needs to be done without their consent or knowledge.  

## Principle 5: Storage and Security of the personal information

### Personal information should be safeguarded to prevent loss, theft, disclosure or misuse. 
- [ ] Ensure you have safeguards like Operational securities which includes staff training. Make sure everyone in the Magazine subscription office has training on security systems and understands all the reasonable steps to prevent loss, theft, disclosure or misuses
- [ ] Physical security such as clear desk policies, have locks and places to hide or safely store information
- [ ] Electronic securities such as password with logins, antivirus software, regular password updates

## Principle 6 Access to Personal Information 

### Be clear on where the personal information is held, let them know that they have the rights to seek confirmation of the right agency having the information. and access to it if needed.  
- [ ] An Online magazine subscription service can create a login or personal detail page for them so they can access the information they have given at any time. 
- [ ] Need to provide assistance with their access, the magazine subscription can have an easy to see icon or page with a support team that is dedicated to helping them access their page.
- [ ] If the personal information is not in the form they requested then we have to inform them and give it to them within 20 working days. e.g they don't want to see an online profile but want the information on paper then we must give it to them in the way they requested within 20 working days.



## Privacy Policy
1. Youtube 
2. The website I have chosen is www.youtube.com, it is an online platform which allows individuals to share, listen and build communities through their own unique voices. Their purpose is to promote freedom of self expression, information and opportunity. Their motto/mission is literally "to give everyone a voice and to show" it to the whole world. You can make an account with Youtube and the type of data they collect is, Name and Gender, Personal details such as as phone number, emails, they collect your digital footprint such as your recent searches and videos you watched or liked, thus based on this information able to configure your interests, hobbies and preferences. So essentially they take both data we have given them and data they collect as we use their services.
