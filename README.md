## Principle 7: Correction of Personal Information

### In order to comply with this particular when developing an IT software we must ensure that there is a way to request and have contact between the clients and vendor when they request that personal information be corrected on the website

- [ ] Have a personal settings page where one can edit their personal information at any time as long as its within the reasons and the confines of what we need/want/allow
- [ ] Have a check system or complaints page where they can directly contact the support team when there is a refusal of correction. The team or page will then explain why certain corrections were refused, and that although we did can't correct they have the rights to complain to a privacy comissioner or they have the rights to have their statement of correction attached to the disputed information.


## Principle 1: Purpose of collection of Personal Information

### An IT software must only collect the personal information that they need for their purpose and use data minimization to ensure no other unnecessary data is collected.

- [ ] Make sure to only include the necessary Personal Information in the collection form. For example an online magazine subscription should only need email address and name not their drivers license and passport numbers.
- [ ] Need to be very clear and explain to the client when collecting personal information the purpose for the data collection. For example an online magazine subscription only needs email and name so they can send the Magazine to the correct person.

## Principle 2: Source of personal information 

### An IT software must establish who the best person is to aquire personal data about an individual from. (Usually the individual who the personal information is about.) However, consent and authentication must be thoroughly checked to insure that the right individual's personal information is being collected. 

- [ ] Have an authentication system that thoroughly confirms and checks the person who we are collecting information from accepts and gives consent for the personal information being collected. This person is usually the person themselves of course. In NZ we can use Realme or use two or three factor authentification systems. For example 1:Email address, 2: Phone Number, 3: Have an app authenticator (Blizzard authenticator app)
- [ ] When the person gives personal data about someone else, make sure you have consent from the individual whom it concerns or that lawfully it is okay. E.g Have a system in place where consent legitamacy can be checked and given or talking to the law enforcement and getting information that way as having the information be aquired with the individuals consent might coincide with the law.
- [ ] Have systems in check for any secrity flaws, e.g have some try and cheat the authentication system or "hack" into a persons account, and have them report the findings and where improvements can be made.
